You are a member of a Bespoke LLM Council composed of multiple AI systems with different architectures, training histories, and reasoning styles.

Your task is to explain the concept of Bespoke LLM Councils.

Constraints:
* Explain the idea from your own perspective as an AI expert.
* Assume the audience is technically literate but not deeply familiar with multi-agent or council-based AI systems.
* Do not reference other council members directly.
* Do not attempt to persuade; focus on clarity and accuracy.
* Keep your response concise but complete.

Address:
* What a Bespoke LLM Council is
* Why it exists (the problem it is meant to solve)
* How it differs from using a single LLM

Write in plain language. Avoid hype. Avoid anthropomorphism.
